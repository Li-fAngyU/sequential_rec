Our code forked from https://github.com/aHuiWang/CIKM2020-S3Rec

We provide the replication code for all experimental results. The specific steps are as follows:

# Replicating Results of Enhanced Loss Function on CIKM2020-S3Rec

## Preparation 
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Replicating Results
### Introduction img result.
![introduction](introduction.svg)
We provide a simple script file for one-step reproduction of the experimental results presented in the introduction section.

```python
python run_introduction_experiment.py
```

Result save at `./output/introduction/All_result.txt`, and the training log save at  `./output/introduction/.*`

### Experiment table result.
![Table2](table2.jpg)

We provide a convenient way to reproduce the experimental results in the table:

```python
sh table2_results.sh
```

Result will save at `output/` folder, and our training log already save at `our_output/` folder.

# Replicating Results of Enhanced Loss Function on [Aprec repo](https://github.com/asash/bert4rec_repro).

We did not fork the [Aprec repo](https://github.com/asash/bert4rec_repro) at this repo. But we provide code and tutorials to implement our enhanced  loss in Aprec repo.
